# Aaishni Mulik

Computer Engineering graduate focused on Machine Learning, Data Science, and intelligent systems. I build projects that move beyond theory into real-world ML engineering — designing models, systems, and data pipelines that solve meaningful problems.

My work reflects a progression from foundational machine learning to system-level thinking, including recommender systems, anomaly detection, and scalable ML architectures.
